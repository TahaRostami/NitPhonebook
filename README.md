 **Note**
To potential supervisors, committee members, hiring managers, and others who are reviewing this repository to assess my implementation skills, I highly recommend visiting my website. In the 'NOTES' section, you can find a dedicated section titled 'Potential Questions,' where I have provided the necessary context for a more comprehensive assessment.

## Problem definition
<p align="justify"> Babol Noshirvani University of Technology (BNUT) had a manual phonebook in a specified format. They tend to develop software that can automate these manual tasks on the one hand. Also, they tend to be able to print the phonebook in a similar format to their manual phonebook, on the other hand. In this regard, they gave my teammates and me the responsibility to analyze, design and implement a prototype that fulfils the mentioned requirements.   </p>

## What we did
<p align="justify">
In this project, we propose a recursive algorithm that can print the given data similar to the manual phone book of the BNUT. Also, we designed and implemented a SQL server database for adding, removing, updating, and fetching information related to the phone book. Afterwards, desktop, mobile, and web clients were designed and implemented.   </p>
